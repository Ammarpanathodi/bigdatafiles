The Hunter and the Pigeons

One day a hunter sets a net to catch birds and placed grains and rice over the net. After
some time a flock of pigeons comes by and start eating grains and get caught in the net.

 

After some time they started losing hope, then their leader asks them to fly together up
in the sky. They did as they were told and carried the net away.
 

The hunter runs after them but they flew away to their friend's mouse hole. Then mouse
cuts the net and freed the pigeons.

 

Moral: Unity is strength.
